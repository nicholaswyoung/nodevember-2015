# Callback-less Asynchrony

This repository houses source code and the presentation for my [2015 Nodevember](http://nodevember.org) talk on Asynchronous Flow Control using langauge feature introduced in the ES2015 standard (colloquially referred to often as "ES6").

## Why This Exists

Several of the new language features introduced in the ES2015 (ECMAScript 6) standard are designed specifically to improve readability and performance of async programs. JavaScript, as a language, is by nature async. It's great, but imperfect. Once the ES2015 specification is finally realized, I believe that JS is ready for it's close-up.

In this repository, I sought to explore how Iterators, Promises, and Generators can work together to help developers write performant, readable, code... without the hassle of callbacks. Avoid the pyramid of doom!
